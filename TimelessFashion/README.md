# Timeless Fashion
# WeHack 2025

## Inspiration
Fast fashion leads to impulse purchases and as such is a major contributor to environmental pollution, with 85% of textiles ending up in landfills each year. We wanted to create something to help with these issues.

## What it does
Timeless Fashion is a mobile app that helps users save money and lessens the negative impacts of fast fashion. Users are able to get inspiration for their next outfit with an assortment of vintage, trending, and future inspired pieces to make up the whole outfit (top, bottom, and an accessory).

## How we built it
We built it using a MERN stack: React Native, MongoDB, and Cloudinary. 

## Challenges we ran into
-Learning React Native to build our frontend

-Setting up MongoDB with the photos and info.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
-Brought a creative spin to a FinTech project

-Learned a lot of new skills

## What we learned
-How to use Figma then code in React Native

-Creating and implementing a database

## What's next for Timeless Fashion?
-Add a sustainability rating by including other factors such as: biodegradability and end-of-life recyclability

-Show users their environmental impact by reselling and buying secondhand (water saved, lbs of textiles saved from landfills)
